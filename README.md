"Website Development for Painters Team | sanya-anton"

As part of a project to create a website for a team of professional painters, I successfully designed and implemented a digital asset. Thanks to this innovative project, the team of painters and their customers have convenient access to important information and services.

Main achievements and features:

Contact Information:
A convenient channel of communication with the team via e-mail and a contact number has been created.

Portfolio:
The developed expanded portfolio allows the team of painters to effectively demonstrate their professional achievements and works, simplifying the selection process for customers.

Prices:
Transparent and accessible information about the prices of painting works is provided, which helps customers to easily determine the cost and choose the best options.

This website was successfully launched in four days and I continue to provide support and professional coaching assistance. I am proud of my contribution to the development of this project and am ready to share more detailed information upon cooperation. It was one of my first IT projects.
